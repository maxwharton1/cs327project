For this project, I have chosen a dataset of historic National Football League game and betting information. 
The dataset has 3 files including the main data file, the stadiums file, and the team file. All data goes back to the
inception of the super bowl era of the National Football League in 1966.

Main file variables:
schedule_date (the specific date of the game), schedule_season (which year), team_home (the home team of the game), 
score_home (final score of the home team), score_away (final score of the away team), team_away (the away team of the game), 
team_favorite_id (which team was predicted to win), spread_favorite (the betting spread for the game), over_under_line (the 
betting line for total points), stadium (the name of the game venue), stadium_neutral (whether or not the game was played at a neutral site),
weather_temperature (the temp at kickoff), weather_wind_mph (wind speed at kickoff), weather_humidity (humidity
percentage at kickoff), and weather_detail (details such as rain or snow present).

Sample data:

The data is very useful in explaining the outcomes of games on a general level. I hope to leverage this data along with
a dataset of more specific team statistics to detect trends for NFL game winners. Hopefully, I would be able to create a predictive 
model for future NFL games and gain a competitive edge in sports gambling.
